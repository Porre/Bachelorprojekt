We present the group structure that arises from a geometric addition of points on elliptic curves. We study endomorphisms on elliptic curves, specifically the Frobenius endomorphism over finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$ is of our interest. We use these endomorphisms to prove Hasse's theorem that gives a bound on the order of the group $E(\mathbb{F}_q)$, and a theorem that makes it possible to determine the order of $E(\mathbb{F}_{q^n})$ when the order of $E(\mathbb{F}_q)$ is known. Lastly we present two factoring algorithms, Pollards $p-1$ algorithm and Lenstras elliptic curve method, where the latter exploits the group structure on elliptic curves to factor integers.
